[Link text](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) - This is where I watch most of the anime I like.
[Link text](https://www.gamestop.com/) - Most of my games are bought from here *though most are bought from in the store*.
* Eat Happy, Be Happy
     * [Link text](https://thekpot.com/) - This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. It is really good for groups but I also like to come by myself and even watch a little anime or other shows while savoring the delicious food.
     * [Link text](https://www.okomehouse.com/) - A restuarant that has quickly become a frequent lunch spot. The food is always fresh and for a good price. *I am currently trying to make my way through each item on the menu.*
     * [Link text](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumbala-bar-and-grill-raleigh) - A place that most would pass up but definitely has good food. The beans are the best I have had tasted in the area and they have other good selections too.
